# Text-Retrieval-Project
## Introduction
This notebook is used to solve the text retrieval problem with two methods: project vector space and transformer.
## Project Vector Space Model (VSM) in Text Retrieval:

The Project Vector Space Model (VSM) is a mathematical model widely used in text retrieval tasks. VSM represents documents and queries as vectors in a multi-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a different term in the term set of the document collection.

### Specifically:

1. **Vectorization of Documents and Queries**:
   - Each document and query is represented as a vector. This vector is usually constructed from the term frequencies of the terms (keywords) in the document or query.
   - Common techniques for creating these vectors include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), Bag of Words (BOW), or word embedding methods like Word2Vec or GloVe.

2. **Vector Space**:
   - Each term in the document collection is considered a dimension in the vector space. Therefore, if there are \( n \) unique terms in the document collection, the vector space will have \( n \) dimensions.
   - The vector of a document or query is a point in this space.

3. **Measuring Similarity**:
   - To determine the relevance between a query and documents, the VSM uses similarity measures such as cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or other metrics.
   - Cosine similarity is a popular choice because it measures the angle between vectors, regardless of their length.

4. **Text Retrieval**:
   - When a query is issued, the system calculates the similarity between the query vector and the vector of each document in the database.
   - Documents with high similarity to the query are considered relevant and are returned to the user.

### Advantages of VSM:
- Simple and easy to understand.
- Effective in handling text retrieval problems through similarity measurement.

### Disadvantages of VSM:
- May struggle with issues of context and term semantics.
- Does not leverage grammatical information or word order in the text.
## Transformer-Based Text Retrieval

The Transformer model has emerged as a powerful architecture for natural language processing tasks, including text retrieval. Leveraging the self-attention mechanism, Transformers excel at capturing contextual information in both queries and documents, making them suitable for text retrieval tasks.

### How Transformers are Utilized:

1. **Vectorization of Text**:
   - Similar to traditional methods, text inputs (queries and documents) are converted into numerical representations. However, instead of simple bag-of-words or TF-IDF approaches, Transformers utilize tokenization and embedding techniques to generate dense, context-aware representations.
   - Tokenization splits the input text into individual tokens (words or subwords), and embeddings map each token to a high-dimensional vector space, capturing its meaning in context.

2. **Contextual Understanding**:
   - The Transformer architecture allows for capturing contextual relationships between tokens in the input text through self-attention mechanisms. This enables the model to understand the semantics and relationships within the text, which is crucial for accurate retrieval.

3. **Information Fusion**:
   - When performing retrieval, the Transformer model processes both the query and the document collection simultaneously, allowing for dynamic interactions between them. The model attends to relevant parts of the query and documents, effectively fusing information from both sources to compute relevance scores.

4. **Scoring and Ranking**:
   - Once the contextual representations are obtained, the model calculates similarity scores between the query and each document in the collection. These scores are used to rank the documents based on their relevance to the query, and the top-ranked documents are returned as results.

### Advantages of Transformer-Based Text Retrieval:
- Superior ability to capture contextual information, leading to more accurate retrieval results.
- Flexibility in handling various types of queries and document collections, including long documents and complex queries.
- Capability to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data, making it suitable for diverse retrieval tasks.

### Challenges and Considerations:
- Computational resources required for training and inference may be substantial, especially for large Transformer models.
- Fine-tuning and optimization of Transformer models for specific retrieval tasks are necessary to achieve optimal performance.
- Interpretability of Transformer-based retrieval models can be challenging due to their complex architecture.
